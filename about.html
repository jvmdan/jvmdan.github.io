                    <h2 class="fw-bolder">The Concept</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        Financial markets are often emotionally driven. In theory, the value of a company should be set by a free market, 
                        driven by the underlying business fundamentals. But the free market is operated by humans & we have feelings. 
                        Whether consciously or not, your <strong>valuation of an asset is influenced by your opinion</strong> 
                        on the greater world around it.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        In practice, the market is very good at collectively valuing a company based upon the information available.
                        But <strong>sometimes it is wrong</strong>. And when it is wrong, this is where we can capitalise and make 
                        money. RxMarkets make use of <strong>advanced data science techniques</strong> to provide a platform for 
                        identifying anomolies in the current price of tradable assets.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder">Analysing Sentiment</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        Markets being wrong is often a result of <strong>market sentiment</strong>. Human emotions muddy decision making, 
                        and prices are affected accordingly. For example, a plane crash will often cause airline stocks to dip immediately
                        because industry sentiment changes overnight. The underlying need for air travel does not. The airlines keep selling
                        tickets, keep making profits, and the 'true' valuation momentarily drifts apart from the current market price. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        Now that is an obvious example & you are unlikely to be able to capitalise on something so predictable. But what if 
                        there are thousands of assets trading every day that are <strong>undervalued or overvalued</strong> as a result of 
                        unconcious bias affecting asset prices? If you can detect such situations, you can profit from it.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        Financial organisations (such as hedge funds) know this and so they attempt to measure sentiment in a number of ways. 
                        Until now, such financial modelling tools were not available to the public. For a large part, their data analysis 
                        is built upon proprietary data collection techniques & processed manually. This is slow, cumbersome & prone to error.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder">Our Product</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        We aim to do better. We use a proprietary <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (AI) engine to analyse 
                        <strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of pieces of data <strong>every single day</strong>. Using this information, 
                        we provide a platform for quantifying & monitoring sentiment across a total of <strong>8 categories</strong>. 
                        Such categories include; industry sentiment, political exposure, confidence in board, employee satisfaction & more.

                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        The autonomous aggregation of this data allows our customers to detect (and capitalise on) anomolies in pricing 
                        due to sudden changes in market sentiment. Our platform is <strong>reactive</strong>, meaning that we can assess
                        the market sentiment of an asset <strong>right now</strong> and act upon it.

                    <p class="lead mb-0">
                        We provide a web platform for viewing the data, along with a comprehensive API for wiring into existing 
                        financial modelling tools. This makes <strong>RxMarkets</strong> a viable option for individual traders
                        & investment organisations alike.
